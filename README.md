# dtm_points_cloud
# how to cropping the file
open the cropping.py file, change the filename and output into the file u want, u can run crop the file

# how to do thinning and convert file to raster file
Open the DataProcess.py and run it change the filename in the thinning and output filename in write_to_raster
the function thinning is to thinning the las file and return a set of points contain x,y,z value in the list
arguments
the mode u can choose thinning method such as random or n-points 
the n_random argument is used for choose the bins if doing n points or n-points random, and teh cellsize is used for grid,cell_manipulation used for method in the cell
and percentage is the points we want to remain after thinning
in the file, we choose random and percentage is 0.1 
(if u choose grid, it may cost i some times)
write_to_raster, input a array of points in shape of(-1,3)
and write a raster file
arguments:
the driver is to choose the driver of raster
filename is the output filenames
crs the proj string of coordinate system, default is epsg:28992

# extract isolines
u can run file extract_isolines, 
write_to_wkt can store the isolines in wkt form
the argument filename is the raster u want to extract isoliens
band is the band u want to extract
levels is the levels of isolines u want to extract
output is the output filename
snap is the tolerence of snap when stick segments together

#how to do csf
points_grid.py
intput a list or array of points containing x,y,z value
and create a object from cloth class, taking that list of points as argument
run the dynamic method implementation_CSF and input the threhold u want the csf process to stop in the function
u can get a list of new particles after ground filtering

to visualize it u can run the draw_3d_plot function to see the particles

# a sample script containning the whole process from from doing csf, convert it to raster, store the result of csf and doing thinning , visualize the final result
using 3d plot function in matplotlib before and after csf and extract_isolins
open main.py file, and read the comment
(notice these file is just use for testing, i strongly recommend u to test it seperately, since we update our code and can't make sure the code in main.py still working or noe
furthermore since python is single thread, and it will takes u loads of time)
